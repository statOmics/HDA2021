# Introduction

Kidney transplantation or renal transplantation is the organ transplant of a
kidney into a patient who has an end-stage renal disease. Scientists claim  that
some genes are responsible for a patient's likelihood of rejecting a kidney
after transplantation.

In this project, you are to investigate this claim. You will analyze data from
the study by @einecke2010molecular. The original data consists of microarray
measurements from 54675 genes across 282 patients. For the purpose of this
project, a random subset was made of 250 patients and 10.000 from the 25% most
variable genes.

You can access the data through the __*HDDAData*__ package, which can be
installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/statOmics/HDDAData) by running the
following code in an R session:

```{r installation, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("statOmics/HDDAData")
```

**Note** that you need to run this piece of code only once. *Don't* include it in your R
script, just run it once in an R console and you're good to go.

After loading the __*HDDAData*__ package, the data will be available as a
`data.frame` with the name `Einecke2010Kidney`:

```{r get-data}
library(HDDAData)

## Data dimensions
dim(Einecke2010Kidney)

## Showing first 6 rows and 10 columns
head(Einecke2010Kidney[, 1:10])
```

More information about the data and its format can be found in the
documentation, see `?Einecke2010Kidney`.

The first column, `Reject_Status`, consists of a __binary variable__ encoding
whether the kidney transplant was accepted (`0`) or rejected (`1`) for each
patient. The other columns contain the microarray expression data for the 10.000
genes. The `rownames` of the data frame contains the patient identifiers.

```{r explroe-data}
## Extract gene expression data as matrix X
X <- as.matrix(Einecke2010Kidney[, -1])
dim(X)
str(X)

## Extract Reject_Status column as vector
reject_status <- Einecke2010Kidney$Reject_Status
names(reject_status) <- rownames(Einecke2010Kidney)
table(reject_status) # number of 0's (accepts) and 1's (rejects)
```

# Assignment

__You must work in groups of four students.__

We are interested in the following research questions:

- How do the genes vary in terms of their gene expression levels? Is the variability associated with kidney rejection? (only to be answered in a data explorative / graphical manner)

- Which genes are differentially expressed between the two kidney rejection groups? You must control the FDR at 10%. 

- Can the kidney rejection  be predicted from the gene expression levels? What genes  are most important in predicting the kidney transplant rejection? How well does the prediction model perform in terms of predicting rejection status?

  Note that the response variable is *binary*, so if you use regression models,
  you will need to use  *logistic regression*, which models the response with a
  binomial distribution. This can generally be done in `R` by specifying `family
  = "binomial"` in regression functions such as `glm` and `glmnet`.


Write a scientific report that answers the research questions related to this study.
The report must consist of two parts:

- An executive summary of about half a page. This summary contains the answers to the original research questions, and should be written in a non-technical manner (it is meant for researchers without a statistical background).
 
- A technical report that explains in detail how the results were obtained. The
reader should understand what you did without looking at the code!

It's recommended to prepare the report as an __RMarkdown__ file. If you choose
to use another format, then the R code should be submitted as a separate file
(please properly comment your R code).

The report is expected to be concise, but must evidently be accurate and
sufficiently detailed to enable the reader to verify the correctness of the
result (i.e. your results must be reproducible). The total length of the report
(excluding graphs, R code and possibly appendices) should not be more than three
pages. The report should not contain an explanation of the theory behind the
statistical methods, and should also not contain the study description given
above (you can assume that the reader already knows this).

__*Interpretation* of the results is key!__

Some more specific guidelines:

- For the first research question, you may use one of the data exploration tools
that we have seen in class. However, you are also free to search the literature
for other techniques for data exploration and visualisation (your final mark
will not depend on whether you searched the literature or not). You are only
asked to *explore* whether the variability in gene expression levels is
associated with rejection status; no need for hypothesis testing.
 
- For the second research question, you should perform hypothesis testing and
correct for multiple testing so as to control the FDR at 10%. The full list with
differentially expressed genes may be presented in an appendix. Only list the
most important results in the body of the report.
 
- For the third research question you are asked to predict rejection status
using gene expression levels. You should randomly split the data into a test
(30%) and a training (70%) dataset. Make sure you use a seed (`set.seed()`
function) in R for reproducibility. The following prediction models should be
evaluated:
  
  * Principal Component Regression (PCR)
    
  * Ridge Regression

  * Lasso regression
  
**Note** that the response variable (the rejection status) is *binary*, so you
will have to use **logistic regression**!

In choosing the number of PCs  in PCR, and the $\gamma$ in the Ridge  and Lasso
models, you need to use cross validation (CV) on the training dataset. You
should use the __area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC)__ as a
performance measure. An example of how to do this for PC Regression can be found
on [UFora](https://ufora.ugent.be/d2l/le/content/444226/viewContent/1116536/View).

Once you have selected the optimal PCR, Ridge and Lasso models, you have to
decide with what model you want to continue. For this final model you have to
determine a good threshold $c$ for the prediction cut-off, where $c$ threshold
where when a predicted probability from your final model $p > c$, we predict
kidney rejection ($y=1$) and non-rejection ($y=0$) otherwise. $c$ should be
chosen such that the *misclassification error* is minimal. This should be
evaluated on the *test data*, i.e. the data not used for training the model.
Also report the *specificity* and *sensitivity* of your final model and cut-off
$c$.

**Hint**: You can find an example function to calculate the misclassification
errors for a range of cut-off values below. This should help you find an optimal
value for $c$.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Inputs:
##   * obs: vector of test observations
##   * pred: vector of model predictions
##   * cutoff_values: vector of prediction thresholds c
calculate_misclass_error <- function(obs, pred, cutoff_values) { 
  stopifnot(lenth(obs) == length(pred))
  
  misclass_errors <- rep(NA, length(cutoff_values))
  
  for (i in seq_along(cutoff_values)) {
    cutoff <- cutoff_values[i]
    ypred <- as.numeric(pred > cutoff) # translates TRUE/FALSE to 1/0 
  
    misclass_errors[i] <- mean(ypred != obs) # proportion of misclassifications
  }
  
  data.frame(
    "cutoff" = cutoff_values,
    "misclass" = misclass_errors
  )
}
```


# Submission

It is recommended (but not mandatory) to prepare your report in __RMarkdown__.
You can render it to either HTML (`output: html_document`) or to PDF (`output: pdf_document`).
In both cases the original `.Rmd` file should be included when handing in the assignment.
If you don't use RMarkdown, you should include the `.R` file(s) containing your implementation and analysis scripts.

When submitting, please use the following format:

* HW-Name1-Name2-Name3-Name4.[pdf|html]

* HW-Name1-Name2-Name3-Name4.R[md]

where `Name` is your __family name__.
It's also recommended to mention your full name in the report itself.

__Submissions should be done through [UFora](https://ufora.ugent.be/d2l/home/444226)__.

<span style="color:red">__The deadline for submission is 16/12/2021 at 23:59__</span>
