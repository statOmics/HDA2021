# Introduction

The purpose of the following exercises is mainly to get more familiar with SVD and its applications, in particular Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
It is recommended to perform the exercises in an `RMarkdown` document.

For a brief introduction to RMarkdown, see [Introduction to RMarkdown](./Introduction-RMarkdown.html).

For an introduction to working with matrices in R, see [Working with Matrices in R](./Introduction-Matrices-R.html).

# Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) demonstration

See [course notes](https://statomics.github.io/HDDA21/svd.html#7_SVD_and_Multi-Dimensional_Scaling_(MDS)) for background.


* We will use `UScitiesD` data as an example
* Our goal is to use the distance matrix $\mathbf D_X$  without knowledge of $\mathbf X$ to represent the rows of $\mathbf X$ in a low dimensional space, say 2D or 3D.
* We search for $\mathbf V_k$ that orthogonally projects the rows of $\mathbf X$ ($\mathbf x^T_i$) onto a $k$-dimensional space spanned by the columns of $\mathbf V_k$. In fact we are looking for $\mathbf Z_k$, such that $\mathbf Z_k=\mathbf X \mathbf V_k$
*  But we do not know $\mathbf X$, so how do we get $\mathbf Z_k$? We will use the $\mathbf G_X$ (gram matrix) trick, mentioned in the course notes


## Example: Distances between US cities

As an example, we will use the `UScitiesD` data set, which is part of base R.
This data gives "straight line" distances (in km) between 10 cities in the US.

```{r, R.options=list(width=100)}
UScitiesD

class(UScitiesD)
```

Note that the `UScitiesD` object is of class `"dist"`, which is a special type of object to represent that it is a __distance matrix__ (we'll denote this as $\mathbf{D}_X$), i.e. the result from computing distances from an original matrix $\mathbf{X}$.
In this case, the original matrix $\mathbf{X}$ was likely a matrix with a row for every city and columns specifying its coordinates.
Note though that we don't know $\mathbf{X}$ exactly.
Still, we can use the distance matrix and MDS to approximate a low-dimensional representation of $\mathbf{X}$.


### Exploring the distance matrix

We first convert the `UScitiesD` to a matrix for easier manipulation and calculation.
Note that this creates a "symmetrical" matrix, with 0s on the diagonal (distance of a city to itself).

```{r}
(dist_mx <- as.matrix(UScitiesD))
```

The dimensions of `dist_mx`:

```{r}
# 10 x 10 square matrix
dim(dist_mx)
```
And the rank of `dist_mx`

```{r}
qr(dist_mx)$rank
```

>Q: is this matrix of full rank?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
A: Yes, it is.

```{r}
qr(dist_mx)$rank == min(dim(dist_mx))
```

</details>



### $\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{G}_X$ matrices

Now let's create the $\mathbf  H$ matrix.

$$ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{I}_{n \times n} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}_n\mathbf{1}_n^T $$
```{r H_matrix}
n <- nrow(dist_mx)

## 11^T
## Alternatively: one_mat <- rep(1, n) %o% rep(1, n)
(one_mat <- matrix(rep(1, n * n), ncol = n, nrow = n))

## Calculate H, diag(n) is the nxn identity matrix
(H <- diag(n) - (1/n) * one_mat)
```

We can use $\mathbf{H}$ to center our distance matrix:

```{r dist_mx_centered}
(dist_mx_centered <- H %*% dist_mx)

## Verify colMeans are 0
round(colMeans(dist_mx_centered), 8)

## Note that using `scale(X, center = TRUE, scale = FALSE)` is much more efficient
## to center a matrix
## Here we use the approach with H because we need it further on
```

We will use this matrix to calculate $\mathbf{G}_X$ (Gram matrix of $\mathbf{X}$).

$$
\mathbf{G}_X = -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{H}\mathbf{D}_X\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T
$$

Where $\mathbf{D}_X$ is the matrix of __*squared* distances__.
So we will first have to square our `dist_mx`.

```{r Gram_matrix}
## D_X = squared distance matrix
D_X <- dist_mx ^ 2

## Gram matrix
(G_X <- -1/2 * H %*% (D_X) %*% H)
```


### The SVD

We can now compute the SVD of the Gram matrix and use it to project our original matrix $\mathbf{X}$ (which is still unknown to us!) into a lower dimensional space while preserving the Euclidean distances as well as possible.
This is the essence of MDS.

```{r GX matrix}
## singular value decomposition on gram matrix
Gx_svd <- svd(G_X)

## Use `str` to explore structure of the SVD object
str(Gx_svd)
```

Components of the `Gx_svd` object:

- `Gx_svd$d`: diagonal elements of the $\mathbf{\Delta}$ matrix, to recreate the matrix, use the `diag()` function
- `Gx_svd$u`: the matrix $\mathbf{U}$ of left singular vectors
- `Gx_svd$v`: the matrix $\mathbf{V}$ of right singular vectors


### Truncated SVD and projection into lower dimensional space

The truncated SVD from the Gram matrix can be used to find projections $Z_k$ of $\mathbf{X}$ in a lower dimensional space.
Here we will use $k = 2$.

```{r}
# k=2 approximation
k <- 2
Uk <- Gx_svd$u[, 1:k]
delta_k <- diag(Gx_svd$d[1:k])
Zk <- Uk %*% sqrt(delta_k)
rownames(Zk) <- colnames(D_X)
colnames(Zk) <- c("Z1", "Z2")
Zk

# Plotting Zk in 2-D

## Using base R
# plot(Zk, type = "n", xlab = "Z1", ylab = "Z2", xlim = c(-1500, 1500))
# text(Zk, rownames(Zk), cex = 1.25)

## Using ggplot, by first converting Zk to a tibble
Zk %>%
  # create tibble and change rownames to column named "city"
  as_tibble(rownames = "city") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Z1, Z2, label = city)) +
    geom_point() +
    # adding the city names as label
    geom_text(nudge_y = 50) +
    # setting limits of the x-axis to center the plot around 0
    xlim(c(-1500, 1500)) +
    ggtitle("MDS plot of the UScitiesD data") +
    theme_minimal()
```

What can you say about the plot?
Think about the real locations of these cities on a map of the US.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
$Z_1$ can be interpreted as the *longitude*, i.e. the East-West position.
$Z_2$ reflects the *latitude*, or the North-South position.
</details>


## The short way

The calculations above demonstrate how MDS works and what the underlying components are.
However, in a real data analysis, one would typically not go through all the hassle of calculating all the intermediate steps.
Fortunately, the MDS is already implemented in base R (in the `stats` package).

So the whole derivation we did above can be reproduced with a single line of code, using the `cmdscale` function (see `?cmdscale` for details).

```{r}
## Calculate MDS in 2 dimensions from distance matrix
(us_mds <- cmdscale(UScitiesD, k = 2))
colnames(us_mds) <- c("Z1", "Z2")

## Plot MDS
us_mds %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "city") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Z1, Z2, label = city)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 50) +
  xlim(c(-1500, 1500)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Which gives us the same result as before (which is a good check that we didn't make mistakes!).



# Exercises

## Cheese data

### Data prep {-}

Load in the `cheese` data, which characterizes 30 cheeses on various metrics.
More information can be found at `?cheese`

```{r}
## Load the 'cheese' dataset from the HDDAData package
data("cheese")
cheese
```

>__Q__: what is the *dimensionality* of this data?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
__A__: 4, since we have 4 features (the first column is just an identifier for the observation, so we don't regard this as a feature).

```{r}
ncol(cheese) - 1
```

</details>

Convert the `cheese` table to a matrix for easier calculations.
We will drop the first column (as it's not a feature) and instead use it to create `rownames`.

```{r}
cheese_mx <- as.matrix(cheese[, -1])
rownames(cheese_mx) <- paste("case", cheese$Case, sep = "_")
cheese_mx
```

Check rank of `cheese_mx` and center the matrix.

```{r}
qr(cheese_mx)$rank

# Centering the data matrix
n <- nrow(cheese_mx)
cheese_H <- diag(n) - 1 / n * matrix(1, ncol = n, nrow = n)
cheese_centered <- cheese_H %*% as.matrix(cheese_mx)
## Again we use H here because we use it for some exercises later on
## In real-life applications using the `scale` function would be more appropriate
```


### Tasks {-}

*Note*: no need for mathematical derivations, just verify code-wise in R.

 We obtained the column-centered data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ after multiplying the original matrix with

$$
\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{I} - \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^T
$$

##### 1. Show that $\mathbf{X}$ (here: `cheese_centered`) is indeed column-centered (and not row-centered) {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r}
# X is indeed column-centered:
round(colMeans(cheese_centered), 14) ## practically zero

# but it is not row-centered:
 rowMeans(cheese_centered)
```
</details>


##### 2. Verify that whenever $\mathbf{X}$ is column-centered, the equality $\mathbf{HX = X}$ holds {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r}
# verifying that HX = X
all.equal(cheese_H %*% cheese_centered, cheese_centered)
```
</details>


##### 3. Perform an SVD on `cheese_centered`, and store the matrices $\mathbf{U}$, $\mathbf{V}$ and $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as separate objects {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r cheese_svd}
cheese_svd <- svd(cheese_centered)
str(cheese_svd)
U <- cheese_svd$u
V <- cheese_svd$v
D <- diag(cheese_svd$d)
```
</details>


##### 4. Show that $\mathbf{u_1}$ is a normalized vector; show the same for $\mathbf{u_2}$. Show that $\mathbf{u_1}$ and $\mathbf{u_2}$ are orthogonal vectors. Then show the orthonormality of all vectors $\mathbf{u_j}$ in a single calculation (using the matrix $\mathbf{U}$). Similarly, show the orthonormality of all vectors $\mathbf{v_j}$ in a single calculation (using the matrix $\mathbf{V}$). {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r}
# Verifying orthonormality
# ------------------------
# The vectors u1 and u2 are orthonormal
t(U[, 1]) %*% U[, 1]
t(U[, 2]) %*% U[, 2]
t(U[, 1]) %*% U[, 2]

# Verifying that U forms an orthonormal basis in one step:
t(U) %*% U # computational imperfections
round(t(U) %*% U, digits = 15)


# Verifying that V forms an orthonormal basis:
t(V) %*% V # computational imperfections
round(t(V) %*% V, digits = 15)
```
</details>


##### 5. Check that the SVD was performed correctly, i.e. calculate the matrix $\mathbf{X}$ from the elements of the SVD. {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

There are 2 ways to do this

  - Using the sum definition of the SVD
    $\mathbf{X} = \sum_{j=1}^r \delta_j \mathbf{u}_j\mathbf{v}_j^T$

```{r}
# Calculating X via the sum definition of the SVD:
# ------------------------------------------------

## Initialize empty matrix
X_sum <- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(U), ncol = ncol(V))

## Compute sum by looping over columns
for (j in 1:ncol(U)) {
  X_sum <- X_sum + (diag(D)[j] * U[, j] %*% t(V[, j]))
}
```

  - using the matrix notation of the SVD

  $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{U}_{n\times n}\boldsymbol{\Delta}_{n\times p}\mathbf{V}^T_{p \times p}$

```{r}
# Calculating X via the SVD matrix multiplication:
# ------------------------------------------------
X_mult <- U %*% D %*% t(V)
```

  - Verify that the obtained results are identical to the  matrix $\mathbf{X}$.

```{r}
## Remove dimnames with unname for comparison
all.equal(X_sum, unname(cheese_centered))
all.equal(X_mult, unname(cheese_centered))
```
</details>

##### 6. Approximate the matrix $\mathbf{\tilde{\mathbf{X}}}$, for $k = 2$ using the truncated SVD. {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

Using the matrix notation of the SVD $\tilde{\mathbf{X}}=\mathbf{U}_{n\times k}\boldsymbol{\Delta}_{k\times k}\mathbf{V}_{p \times k}^T$

```{r}
k <- 2
X_tilde <- U[, 1:k] %*% D[1:k,1:k] %*% t(V[,1:k])
X_tilde
```

- Compare the obtained results with the matrix $\mathbf{X}$ (`cheese_centered`).
Just at a first glance, does it seem that $\mathbf{\tilde{X}}$ is a good approximation of $\mathbf{X}$?


##### 7. SVD and linear regression: perform a linear regression using SVD to estimate the effects of the `Acetic`, `H2S` and `Lactic` variables on the `taste`. {-}

Note: we cannot use the SVD from before as this was calculated from the complete `cheese` table, also including the `taste` column, which is the response variable of interest here.
Instead, we need to create a new design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ containing the predictors and a separate vector $\mathbf{y}$ containing the response.

```{r}
cheese_y <- cheese$taste
cheese_design <- cbind(Intercept = 1, cheese[c("Acetic", "H2S", "Lactic")])
```

Also perform the regression with `lm` and compare the results.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```{r}
## Fit with lm
lm_fit <- lm(taste ~ Acetic + H2S + Lactic, data = cheese)

## Fit with SVD
design_svd <- svd(cheese_design)
svd_coef <- design_svd$v %*% diag(1/design_svd$d) %*% t(design_svd$u) %*% cheese_y

## Compare
cbind(
  "lm" = coef(lm_fit),
  "svd" = drop(svd_coef)
)
```
</details>


## Exercise: employment by industry in European countries

In this exercise we will focus on the interpretation of the *biplot*.

### Data prep {-}

The `"industries"` dataset contains data on the distribution of employment between 9 industrial
sectors, in 26 European countries. The dataset stems from the Cold-War era; the data are expressed
as percentages. Load the data and explore its contents.

```{r read-industries-data}
## Load 'industries' data from the HDDAData package
data("industries")

# Explore contents
industries
dim(industries)
summary(industries)
```

Create data matrix $\mathbf{X}$.

```{r}
# Create matrix without first column ("country", which will be used for rownames)
indus_X <- as.matrix(industries[, -1])
rownames(indus_X) <- industries$country

# Check the dimensionality
dim(indus_X)

# and the rank
qr(indus_X)$rank

# n will be used subsequently
n <- nrow(indus_X)
```


### Tasks {-}

##### 1. Perform a truncated SVD for $k=2$, and construct the biplot accordingly. {-}

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```{r}
# Centering the data matrix first
# H <- diag(n) - 1 / n * matrix(1, ncol = n, nrow = n)
# indus_centered <- H %*% as.matrix(indus_X)
indus_centered <- scale(indus_X, scale = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Perform SVD
indus_svd <- svd(indus_centered)
str(indus_svd)

# Extract singular vectors for k = 2 and calculate k=2 projection Zk
k <- 2
Uk <- indus_svd$u[ , 1:k]
Dk <- diag(indus_svd$d[1:k])

Vk <- indus_svd$v[, 1:k]
rownames(Vk) <- colnames(indus_X)
colnames(Vk) <- c("V1", "V2")

Zk <- Uk %*% Dk
rownames(Zk) <- industries$country
colnames(Zk) <- c("Z1", "Z2")
Zk
```

Biplot with *ggplot2*:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
## Scale factor to draw Vk arrows (can be set arbitrarily)
scale_factor <- 20

## Create tibble with rownames in "country" column
as_tibble(Zk, rownames = "country") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Z1, Z2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 3, nudge_y = 0.5) +
  ## Plot Singular vectors Vk
  geom_segment(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = V1 * scale_factor, yend = V2 * scale_factor),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm")),
    color = "firebrick"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(V1 * scale_factor, V2 * scale_factor, label = sector),
    nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = ifelse(Vk[, 2] >= 0, 0.5, -0.5),
    color = "firebrick", size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Using base R:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# # Constructing the biplot for Z1 and Z2
#  # -------------------------------------
plot(Zk[, 1:2],
  type = "n", xlim = c(-30, 60), ylim = c(-15, 15),
  xlab = "Z1", ylab = "Z2"
)
text(Zk[, 1:2], rownames(Zk), cex = 0.9)
# alpha <- 1
alpha <- 20 # rescaling to get better visualisation
for (i in 1:9) {
  arrows(0, 0, alpha * Vk[i, 1], alpha * Vk[i, 2], length = 0.2, col = 2)
  text(alpha * Vk[i, 1], alpha * Vk[i, 2], rownames(Vk)[i], col = 2)
}
```
</details>

##### 2. To see if we can learn more when retaining more dimensions, repeat the truncated SVD for $k=3$. Construct two-dimensional biplots for: {-}

- Z1 and Z3
- Z2 and Z3

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

No need to re-do SVD, just extract singular vectors for $k=3$ from previous SVD.

```{r}
# Extract singular vectors for k = 3 and calculate projection Zk
k <- 3
Uk <- indus_svd$u[ , 1:k]
Dk <- diag(indus_svd$d[1:k])

Vk <- indus_svd$v[, 1:k]
rownames(Vk) <- colnames(indus_X)
colnames(Vk) <- c("V1", "V2", "V3")

Zk <- Uk %*% Dk
rownames(Zk) <- industries$country
colnames(Zk) <- c("Z1", "Z2", "Z3")
Zk
```

Create biplot as before.

- Z1 *vs.* Z3

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
## Scale factor to draw Vk arrows (can be set arbitrarily)
scale_factor <- 20

## Create tibble with rownames in "country" column
as_tibble(Zk, rownames = "country") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Z1, Z3)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 3, nudge_y = 0.5) +
  ## Plot Singular vectors Vk
  geom_segment(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = V1 * scale_factor, yend = V3 * scale_factor),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm")),
    color = "firebrick"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(V1 * scale_factor, V3 * scale_factor, label = sector),
    nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = ifelse(Vk[, 3] >= 0, 0.5, -0.5),
    color = "firebrick", size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


- Z2 *vs.* Z3

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
# Scale factor to draw Vk arrows (can be set arbitrarily)
scale_factor <- 20

## Create tibble with rownames in "country" column
as_tibble(Zk, rownames = "country") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Z2, Z3)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 3, nudge_y = 0.5) +
  ## Plot Singular vectors Vk
  geom_segment(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = V2 * scale_factor, yend = V3 * scale_factor),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm")),
    color = "firebrick"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = as_tibble(Vk, rownames = "sector"),
    aes(V2 * scale_factor, V3 * scale_factor, label = sector),
    nudge_x = 0.5, nudge_y = ifelse(Vk[, 3] >= 0, 0.5, -0.5),
    color = "firebrick", size = 3
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


##### 3. Can you give a meaningful interpretation to each dimension? {-}


```{r, child="_session-info.Rmd"}
```
