Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a multivariate data analysis method that aims at finding
correlations between two multivariate data sets, $X$ and $Y$. The method looks for the linear
combination of the $X$-variables and the linear combination of the $Y$-variables that show maximal
correlation. When the number of variables in $X$ and/or $Y$ is very large (high-dimensional), the
classical CCA method needs to be adapted to deal with the high dimensionality.

The aim of this homework assignment is:

* to understand the classical CCA method (based on the literature) and a CCA method for
  high-dimensional data

* to implement the CCA method and its high-dimensional version (not using existing R packages or R
  functions for CCA)

* apply the method to a dataset

You may consult the literature to find a description of the CCA method. Here I give one possible
reference (it is a paper about an R package, but remember that you may not use this R package for
the implementation):

González, I., Déjean, S., Martin, P. G., & Baccini, A. (2008). CCA: An R package to extend canonical
correlation analysis. Journal of Statistical Software, 23(12), 1-14.
<http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v023.i12>

The paper also describes a *regularised CCA* method (section 2.4), which is applicable to
high-dimensional data. However, there are other high-dimensional CCA methods described in the
literature. You are free to choose the regularised CCA from the paper, or any other appropriate
high-dimensional CCA method.

Note that in the paper a cross-validation method is proposed for selecting e.g. the tuning
parameters in the regularised CCA. __*You are not required to implement this*__. If tuning
parameters are involved, you may set them manually to an arbitrary value (or play with it when
analysing the dataset and set it to a value that seems appropriate to you -- no need to motivate
your choice).

You must apply your implemented method to the **nutrimouse** data, which is part of the
`r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("CCA")` R package. More information about the data can be found in the paper.
You must only look at the first two dimensions of the CCA, which will allow you to make
two-dimensional graphs.

The dataset can be accessed in R as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Check if CCA package is installed and install it if it's not
if (!requireNamespace("CCA", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("CCA")
}

library(CCA)
data("nutrimouse")

X <- nutrimouse$gene  # the gene expression matrix
dim(X)
Y <- nutrimouse$lipid # the lipids matrix
dim(Y)
```

The assignment should be done __alone__ or in __groups of 2__.

You should write a report containing the following:

* A short (mathematical) description of the CCA methods (classical and high-dimensional) that you
  have implemented

* The application of your method to the *nutrimouse* data

  - Classical CCA on multivariate data with $p < n$. (*Hint: it will not be possible to apply the
    classical CCA method to the full data matrix $X$. You should subset the data to reflect the case
    of $p < n$*.)

  - High-dimensional CCA on data with $p > n$

* Interpretation and conclusion of the data analysis results

The length of the written report (excluding R code, R output and graphs) should be about 2 pages.

It is recommended (but not mandatory) to prepare your report in __RMarkdown__. You can render it to
either HTML (`output: html_document`) or to PDF (`output: pdf_document`). In both cases the original
`.Rmd` file should be included when handing in the assignment. If you don't use RMarkdown, you
should include the `.R` file(s) containing your implementation and analysis scripts.

When submitting, please use the following format:

* Report: `HW-Name1-Name2.[pdf|html]`

* Source codde: `HW-Name1-Name2.Rmd` (or `HW1-Name1-Name2.R`)

Submissions should be done __through [UFora](https://ufora.ugent.be/d2l/home/444226)__ under the
"Assignments" tab (`UFora-tools --> Assignments`).
