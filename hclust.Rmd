# Introduction
## Objective

Objective: grouping of observations into **clusters**, so that

- similar observations appear in the same cluster
- dissimilar observations appear in distinct clusters

$\longrightarrow$ need for a measure for **similarity** and **dissimilarity**?


## Example 1

Single cell transcriptomics:  $n \times p$ Matrix for which

  - every column contains the expression levels of one of $p$ genes for $n$ cells
  
  - every row contains the expression levels of $p$ genes for one cell (**sample**)

  - Research question: look for groups of cells that have similar gene expression patterns

 - Or, look for groups of genes that have similar expression levels across the different cells. This can
 help us in understanding the regulation and functionality of the genes.

 $\longrightarrow$ both **observations** (rows) and **variables** (columns) can be clustered


## Example 2.

Abundance studies: the abundances of $n$ plant species are counted on $p$ plots (habitats)

  - look for groups that contain species that live in the same habitats, or, look for groups of
 habitats that have similar species communities

$\longrightarrow$ both **observations** (rows) and **variables** (columns) can be clustered


# Hierarchical Cluster Analysis: Agnes

## General Algorithm

- In step 0 each observations is considered as a cluster (i.e. $n$ clusters).

- Every next step consists of:

   1. merge the two clusters with the smallest intercluster dissimilarity
   2. recalculate the intercluster dissimilarities

In step 0 the intercluster dissimilarity coincides with the dissimilarity between the corresponding observations 

$\rightarrow$ intercluster dissimilarity?

## Intercluster Dissimilarities

- Represent clusters (e.g. $C_1$ and $C_2$)
   as sets of points $\mathbf{x}_i$ which belong to that cluster

- $d(C_1,C_2)$: intercluster dissimilarity between

We consider three intercluster dissimilarities.

### Single Linkage = Nearest Neighbour

\[
  d(C_1,C_2) = \min_{\mathbf{x}_1 \in C_1; \mathbf{x}_2 \in C_2}
  d(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2) ,
\]

i.e. the dissimilarity between $C_1$ and $C_2$ is determined by the smallest dissimilarity between a point of $C_1$ and a point of $C_2$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/hclustNearest.png")
```

### Complete Linkage = Furthest Neighbour
   \[
    d(C_1,C_2) = \max_{\mathbf{x}_1 \in C_1; \mathbf{x}_2 \in C_2}
    d(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2) ,
   \]
   i.e. the dissimilarity between $C_1$ and $C_2$ is determined by the largest dissimilarity between a point of $C_1$ and a
   point of $C_2$.


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/hclustFurthest.png")
```

### Average Linkage = Group Average

   \[
    d(C_1,C_2) = \frac{1}{\vert C_1 \vert \vert C_2 \vert}
    \sum_{\mathbf{x}_1 \in C_1; \mathbf{x}_2 \in C_2}
    d(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2) ,
   \]
   i.e. the dissimilarity between $C_1$ and $C_2$ is determined by the average dissimilarity between all points of $C_1$ and all
   points of $C_2$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/hclustAverage.png")
```


## Cluster Tree

Hierarchical nature of the algorithm:

- Nested sequence of clusters $\longrightarrow$ visualisation via a tree  


- height of branches indicate the intercluster dissimilarity at which clusters are merged.

- Can used as instrument for deciding the number of clusters in the data


# Toy example


```{r echo = FALSE}
toy <- data.frame(
  X1 = c(1.50,
         2.00,
         2.50,
         2.00,
         2.25),
  X2 = c(2.40,
         2.50,
         2.25,
         3.00,
         3.20),
  label = 1:5
  )

knitr::kable(toy)
```

```{r}
library(cluster)
library(tidyverse)

toy %>%
  ggplot(aes(X1, X2, label = label)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(nudge_x = .05)

toy[,1:2] %>% dist
```

## Single linkage

```{r}
toySingle <- agnes(toy[,1:2], method = "single")
par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty="s")
plot(X2 ~ X1, toy, xlim = c(1.25,2.75),ylim = c(2,3.5))
text(toy$X1*1.05,toy$X2,label=toy$label)
plot(toySingle, which.plot = 2, main = "Single")
toy[,1:2] %>% dist
```

## Complete linkage

```{r}
toyComplete <- agnes(toy[,1:2], method = "complete")
par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty="s")
plot(X2 ~ X1, toy, xlim = c(1.25,2.75),ylim = c(2,3.5))
text(toy$X1*1.05,toy$X2,label=toy$label)
plot(toyComplete, which.plot = 2, main = "Complete")
toy[,1:2] %>% dist
```

## Average linkage

```{r}
toyAvg <- agnes(toy[,1:2], method = "average")
par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty="s")
plot(X2 ~ X1, toy, xlim = c(1.25,2.75),ylim = c(2,3.5))
text(toy$X1*1.05,toy$X2,label=toy$label)
plot(toyAvg, which.plot = 2, main = "Average")
toy[,1:2] %>% dist
```
